This repository covers my whole pc *env*ironment.
Major of it are currently config files.

It should also help me to better:
- use git/..
- find my own way to describe commits


# Keywords for commits
[MSO]: Messy-SOrt (hope not so use it often)
[ME]:  Mini-Enhacements

# alias (kinda)
"~" := "â‰ˆ" // I use neo-layout, still not easy.


# small plans
Exclude dotfiles/config/vifm/vifminfo.json from git
-> maybe that's what is .gitignore only used for?
